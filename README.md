A task I made for a trainee position. 

The task itself: 

"
1) Generate plausible data on page load;
2) Initially, the table is sorted according to the final places in the race;
3) Additionally, it should be possible to sort by: name, hits, rate of fire;
4) Search by name;

Stack: any framework, any libraries."

To run it: 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 
2. Run `npm i` or `yarn install` in your terminal. 
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` in your terminal.
